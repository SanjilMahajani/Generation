# Data Generation Scheduler

## Overview
This project aims to automate the generation of data sources based on specified date ranges. The motivation behind this project is to eliminate manual errors and ensure that all necessary data sources are generated within the given timeframe.

## Functionality
The program prompts the user to input a start date and an end date, defining the range within which data sources need to be generated. It then determines which data sources require generation within this range based on their specific generation rules.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Input the start date (in the format: dd/mm).
3. Input the end date (in the format: dd/mm).
4. The program will display the list of data sources to be generated within the specified date range.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x

## Future Updates

I am working to improve this project and add new features. Here are some updates I plan to implement in the future:

- **Creation of Flask Web Application**: The next update to this project will involve transforming the data generation scheduler into a Flask web application. This will allow users to interact with the scheduler through a user-friendly web interface.
